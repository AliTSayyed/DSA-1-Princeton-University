/*
Given a social network containing ùëõ members and a log file containing ùëö timestamps at which times pairs of
members formed friendships, design an algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are connected
(i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend). Assume that the log file is sorted by
timestamp and that friendship is an equivalence relation. The running time of your algorithm should be proportional to n.
